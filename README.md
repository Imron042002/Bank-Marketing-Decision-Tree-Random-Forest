#  Machine Learning Project - CRISP-DM Approach

##  Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to a classification problem, following the **CRISP-DM** methodology. The goal is to train and evaluate a model that predicts a binary outcome using structured data.

---

## 1.  Business Understanding

* **Objective**: To build a predictive model that classifies instances into one of two categories (`yes` or `no`), aiming to support decision-making processes in a business context.
* **Success Criteria**: High classification accuracy and meaningful model interpretation (e.g., via decision trees).

---

## 2.  Data Understanding

* **Dataset Summary**:

  * The dataset is imported and previewed using `head()`.
  * Feature distribution and correlation are explored.
* **Key Steps**:

  * Use of `pandas` and `matplotlib` for exploration.
  * Visual inspection of distributions and possible class imbalances.

---

## 3.  Data Preparation

* **Missing Values**: Checked and removed using `dropna()`.
* **Encoding**:

  * Categorical variables are encoded using `LabelEncoder` or dummy variables.
* **Splitting**:

  * Dataset is split into training and test sets using `train_test_split()` from scikit-learn.

---

## 4.  Modeling

* **Model Used**: Decision Tree Classifier (`DecisionTreeClassifier` from `sklearn`).
* **Parameters**: Default or specified manually (e.g., `max_depth`, `criterion`).
* **Training**:

  * The model is trained on the preprocessed training data.

---

## 5.  Evaluation

* **Metrics Used**:

  * Accuracy
  * Confusion Matrix
  * Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
* **Visualization**:

  * Tree plotted using `plot_tree()` with feature and class names for interpretability.
* **Performance Summary**:

  * Model results are visualized and assessed for overfitting or underfitting.

## 6.  Deployment (Optional/Future Scope)

* This project does not include deployment yet.
* For production, consider:

  * Exporting model using `joblib` or `pickle`
  * Wrapping in a Flask or FastAPI service
  * Frontend interface or API

---

##  Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`
